# timer

Shareable short link timer of an event.

I couldn't find a simple service online to share events with my friends on mobile games around the world where time zones usually make a mess of that.

A single html file uses client time to set a Unix Timestamp into a short url to share with everyone. Uses Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron](Orbitron) for the clock face, [https://flatpickr.js.org/](Flatpickr) and [https://momentjs.com/](Moment.js) from CDN.
