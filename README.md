# timer

Shareable short link timer of an event.

I couldn't find a simple service online to share events with my friends on mobile games around the world, where time zones usually make a mess of getting together at a fixed time. Everyone kept trying to convert to their own timezones, usually failing at that because then no one remembered what the time was. This was thought to solve that.

A single html file uses client side time to set a Unix Timestamp into a short url to share with everyone. Uses Google Fonts [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron) for the clock face, [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) from CDN.
